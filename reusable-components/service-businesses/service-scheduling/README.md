# Service Scheduling

> Staff assignment, time availability, and calendar coordination.

**Component ID:** `service-scheduling`
**Industry:** Service-based businesses
**Stability:** experimental — structure & contract are stable; first safe increment of functionality is implemented.

> ⚠️ **This component handles sensitive data.** All read and write paths MUST go through the documented API so that tenant isolation, permission checks, and audit logging are enforced. Direct table access is forbidden. See `ai-instructions/security-rules.md`.

## Purpose

Manage staff availability (working hours, time off) and provide the availability query that service-booking uses for conflict detection.

## Business problem solved

Without structured availability, bookings are taken against unknown staff schedules. This component makes availability queryable.

## Supported industries

Service-based businesses.

This component is **reusable** across all businesses in its industry. Variation between businesses is expressed through configuration, not through forks of the source. See `ai-instructions/architecture-rules.md` §4 (Configuration Over Customization).

## Features

- Declare staff working hours per day
- Declare time off
- Query availability for a time slot
- Per-tenant isolation

## Dependencies

- `@business-os/shared`

## Configuration options

- `defaultWorkingStartHour` (`number`, default `9`) — Default working start hour.
- `defaultWorkingEndHour` (`number`, default `17`) — Default working end hour.

See `config/defaults.ts` for the runtime defaults and `config/schema.ts` for the schema.

## Permissions required

The component expects the following permissions to exist in the tenant's authorization model. Each permission is checked at the boundary of the corresponding operation — see `backend/logic.ts`.

- `service.scheduling.manage`
- `service.scheduling.read`

## Data handled

Staff identity, working hours, time off. PII.

The component owns its data. Other components interact with it **only** through the public API exported from `backend/index.ts`. Direct table access is forbidden — it bypasses tenant isolation and audit logging.

## API interfaces

The public API surface is exported from `backend/index.ts`. The full request/response contract is documented in `documentation/contract.md`. The TypeScript types in `backend/types.ts` are the canonical contract — if the docs and the types disagree, the types win.

## Limitations

- No recurring time off (e.g. every Monday).
- No timezone awareness — assumes tenant-local time.

## Future improvements

- Recurring time off.
- Timezone awareness.
- Capacity planning.
