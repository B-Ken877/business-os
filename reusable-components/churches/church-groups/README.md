# Church Groups

> Small groups, ministry groups, leaders, and group participation.

**Component ID:** `church-groups`
**Industry:** Churches / faith-based
**Stability:** experimental — structure & contract are stable; first safe increment of functionality is implemented.

> ⚠️ **This component handles sensitive data.** All read and write paths MUST go through the documented API so that tenant isolation, permission checks, and audit logging are enforced. Direct table access is forbidden. See `ai-instructions/security-rules.md`.

## Purpose

Manage small groups (Bible studies, youth groups, ministry teams), their leaders, and their members.

## Business problem solved

Group membership is informal and changes often. This component makes it queryable.

## Supported industries

Churches / faith-based.

This component is **reusable** across all businesses in its industry. Variation between businesses is expressed through configuration, not through forks of the source. See `ai-instructions/architecture-rules.md` §4 (Configuration Over Customization).

## Features

- Create groups
- Assign leaders
- Track member participation
- Per-tenant isolation

## Dependencies

- `@business-os/shared`

## Configuration options

- `maxGroupsPerTenant` (`number`, default `100`) — Cap on groups.
- `defaultMaxMembers` (`number`, default `30`) — Default max members per group.

See `config/defaults.ts` for the runtime defaults and `config/schema.ts` for the schema.

## Permissions required

The component expects the following permissions to exist in the tenant's authorization model. Each permission is checked at the boundary of the corresponding operation — see `backend/logic.ts`.

- `church.groups.manage`
- `church.groups.read`
- `church.groups.join`

## Data handled

Group membership reveals religious participation; treat as sensitive.

The component owns its data. Other components interact with it **only** through the public API exported from `backend/index.ts`. Direct table access is forbidden — it bypasses tenant isolation and audit logging.

## API interfaces

The public API surface is exported from `backend/index.ts`. The full request/response contract is documented in `documentation/contract.md`. The TypeScript types in `backend/types.ts` are the canonical contract — if the docs and the types disagree, the types win.

## Limitations

- No group meeting scheduling.
- No group communication.

## Future improvements

- Group meeting scheduling.
- Group chat via messaging-center.
- Role rotation.
